# Kuroba (Clover) https://vibing-onion.github.io/Kuroba/
Kuroba is a word-guessing game, trying to simulate Wordle & Semantle.

# Rules
1. The secret word is refreshed everyday at 00:00
2. The letter will appear if and only if the letter's position matches.
   (if you guess the exact word, it obviously appears as well lol)
3. Game ends if all the letters appear.
